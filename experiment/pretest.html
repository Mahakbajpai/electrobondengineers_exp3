        question: "What is the general formula of an ester?",
        answers: {
          a: "R-COOH",
          b: "R-COOR'",
          c: "R-OH",
          d: "R-CHO"
        },
        correctAnswer: "b",
        explanation: {
          a: "R-COOH represents carboxylic acids, not esters.",
          b: "✅ Correct! Esters have the formula R-COOR', where R and R' are alkyl groups.",
          c: "R-OH is the formula for alcohols.",
          d: "R-CHO is the formula for aldehydes."
        },
        difficulty: "beginner"
      },
      {
        question: "In the hydrolysis of esters under acidic conditions, what is the main product?",
        answers: {
          a: "Alcohol and acid",
          b: "Alcohol and ester",
          c: "Ketone and water",
          d: "Alkene and acid"
        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: {
          a: "✅ Correct! Acid hydrolysis of esters produces an alcohol and a carboxylic acid.",
          b: "Ester is the reactant, not the product.",
          c: "Ketones are not formed in ester hydrolysis.",
          d: "Alkenes are not produced in this reaction."
        },
        difficulty: "beginner"
      },
      {
        question: "Which factor affects the rate constant of ester hydrolysis?",
        answers: {
          a: "Concentration of ester",
          b: "Type of catalyst",
          c: "Temperature",
          d: "All of the above"
        },
        correctAnswer: "d",
        explanation: {
          a: "Concentration influences reaction rate but rate constant depends on other factors.",
          b: "Catalysts affect the rate constant by providing alternate pathways.",
          c: "Temperature affects the rate constant according to the Arrhenius equation.",
          d: "✅ Correct! All these factors influence the rate constant."
        },
        difficulty: "intermediate"
      },
      {
        question: "Which method is commonly used to determine the rate constant of hydrolysis of esters?",
        answers: {
          a: "Measuring change in pH over time",
          b: "Measuring volume of gas produced",
          c: "Titration of unreacted ester",
          d: "Spectrophotometric analysis of reaction mixture"
