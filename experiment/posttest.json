    {
      "question": "What role does the acid catalyst play in ester hydrolysis?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It speeds up the reaction without being consumed",
        "b": "It gets consumed during the reaction",
        "c": "It prevents the reaction",
        "d": "It converts ester to ketone"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! The acid catalyst lowers activation energy and is regenerated.",
        "b": "Catalysts are not consumed in the reaction.",
        "c": "The acid catalyst promotes the reaction.",
        "d": "Esters are not converted to ketones in hydrolysis."

      "question": "Which graph is used to determine the rate constant for a first-order ester hydrolysis reaction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Concentration vs. time",
        "b": "Logarithm of concentration vs. time",
        "c": "Rate vs. concentration",
        "d": "Volume vs. time"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "For first-order, a logarithmic plot is preferred.",
        "b": "Correct! Plotting ln[ester] vs. time yields a straight line for first-order reactions.",
        "c": "Rate vs. concentration is used for reaction order determination.",
        "d": "Volume is not typically plotted here."

      "question": "If the rate constant doubles when temperature increases by 10°C, what does this imply?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The reaction is temperature-independent",
        "b": "The reaction is highly sensitive to temperature",
        "c": "The reaction is zero order",
        "d": "The catalyst is ineffective"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Rate constants usually increase with temperature.",
        "b": "Correct! This follows the Arrhenius equation and indicates sensitivity.",
        "c": "Order does not determine temperature dependence.",
        "d": "Catalyst effectiveness is unrelated here."

      "question": "What units are typically used for the rate constant in a first-order reaction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "mol/L",
        "b": "L/mol·s",
        "c": "s⁻¹",
        "d": "mol/L·s"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is concentration, not a rate constant unit.",
        "b": "This is typical for second-order reactions.",
        "c": "Correct! For first-order reactions, rate constant units are reciprocal time.",
        "d": "This is rate unit."

      "question": "Which of these can cause errors in determining the rate constant of ester hydrolysis?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Impurities in reagents",
        "b": "Inaccurate temperature control",
        "c": "Errors in pH measurement",
