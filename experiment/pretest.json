      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "R-COOH represents carboxylic acids, not esters.",
        "b": "Correct! Esters have the formula R-COOR', where R and R' are alkyl groups.",
        "c": "R-OH is the formula for alcohols.",
        "d": "R-CHO is the formula for aldehydes."

        "d": "Alkene and acid"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Acid hydrolysis of esters produces an alcohol and a carboxylic acid.",
        "b": "Ester is the reactant, not the product.",
        "c": "Ketones are not formed in ester hydrolysis.",

        "d": "All of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Concentration influences reaction rate but rate constant depends on other factors.",
        "b": "Catalysts affect the rate constant by providing alternate pathways.",
        "c": "Temperature affects the rate constant according to the Arrhenius equation.",

      "question": "Which method is commonly used to determine the rate constant of hydrolysis of esters?",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! The change in pH due to acid formation is often measured.",
        "b": "No gas is produced in typical ester hydrolysis.",
        "c": "Titration of unreacted ester is less common than titrating acid produced.",
        "d": "Spectrophotometry is not typically used here."

      "question": "What order of reaction is typically observed for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of esters?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Zero order",
        "b": "First order",
        "c": "Second order",
        "d": "Third order"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Zero order means rate independent of concentration, which is not typical here.",
        "b": "Correct! The reaction is generally first order with respect to the ester concentration.",
        "c": "Second order would involve more complex mechanisms.",
        "d": "Third order is uncommon for this reaction."
