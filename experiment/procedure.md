### 🔬 Procedure: Determination of Rate Constant of Hydrolysis of Esters
Objective:
To determine the rate constant (k) of the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of ethyl acetate using titration method.

Materials Required:
Ethyl acetate (CH₃COOC₂H₅)

Dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl)

Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution (standard)

Phenolphthalein indicator

Distilled water

Burette, pipette, conical flask, measuring cylinder, stopwatch, water bath

Principle:
Ethyl acetate undergoes acid-catalyzed hydrolysis in the presence of dilute HCl:

CH₃COOC₂H₅ + H₂O → CH₃COOH + C₂H₅OH
This is a pseudo-first-order reaction as water is in large excess. The progress of the reaction is followed by titrating the acetic acid formed at regular time intervals with standard NaOH.

Experimental Steps:
Preparation of Reaction Mixture:

In a clean flask, mix a known volume of ethyl acetate and dilute hydrochloric acid.

Quickly place the flask in a water bath at a constant temperature (usually 60°C) to maintain uniform reaction conditions.

Starting the Reaction:

Note the starting time (t = 0).

At regular time intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes), withdraw fixed volume (e.g., 5 mL) of the reaction mixture.

Quenching the Reaction:

Immediately pour the withdrawn sample into a conical flask containing a known amount of ice-cold standard NaOH solution to stop the reaction.

Titration:

Titrate the excess NaOH with standard HCl using phenolphthalein as indicator to determine how much NaOH reacted with the acetic acid formed.

Repeat Steps 2–4 for multiple time intervals (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes).

Calculate the amount of acetic acid formed at each interval and use the first-order rate law to determine the rate constant (k):

𝑘=2.303/𝑡(log(𝑉∞−𝑉0/𝑉∞−𝑉𝑡)
Where:

𝑉0 = volume of NaOH used at time 0
𝑉𝑡 = volume of NaOH used at time t
V∞ = volume at completion (after long time or heating)

Notes:
Use water bath to maintain constant temperature throughout the experiment.

Ensure accurate timing and consistent titration technique.

The reaction is assumed to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics due to excess water.
